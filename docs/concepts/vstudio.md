# V Studio

> The Interactive "Final 10-20%" Finishing Environment

## Overview

**V Studio** is AudiFi's collaborative music production environment where artists, producers, and fans come together to finalize tracks before they launch as Master IPOs. It transforms the traditionally closed final stages of music production into an interactive, community-driven experience.

---

## The Concept

Most music production follows a standard flow:
1. **Writing** - Composition and lyrics (0-30%)
2. **Recording** - Initial tracking and takes (30-60%)
3. **Production** - Arrangement and sound design (60-80%)
4. **Mixing** - Balance and polish (80-90%)
5. **Mastering** - Final preparation (90-100%)

V Studio focuses on that **final 10-20%** - the stage where key creative decisions are made that shape the listener's experience. Instead of these decisions happening behind closed doors, they happen with community input.
