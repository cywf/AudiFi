## 3. Master IPO Mechanics

### 3.1 Overview

A "Master IPO" allows you to:
- Designate a Master recording for revenue-share distribution
- Mint NFTs (ERC-721C standard) representing shares in the Master's revenue
- Enable collectors to participate in the Master's financial performance

### 3.2 NFTs Representing Master Shares

NFTs minted through a Master IPO:
- Are recorded on the blockchain using the ERC-721C standard
- Represent digital claims to revenue shares as encoded in the smart contract
- Include royalty mechanics (ERC-2981 integration)
- Are subject to the terms encoded in the smart contract code

**IMPORTANT:** NFTs represent digital assets with associated contractual rights as described on the platform. They do NOT necessarily represent:
- Ownership of copyright in the underlying Master
- Traditional equity or securities (subject to regulatory interpretation)
- Guaranteed financial returns

### 3.3 Revenue Distribution

Revenue from Masters may be distributed to NFT holders through smart contract mechanics. Distribution is subject to:
- Proper revenue recognition and calculation
- Platform fee deductions
- Smart contract operational requirements
- Available liquidity and blockchain transaction capabilities

AudiFi does not guarantee:
- Specific revenue amounts or timing
- Uninterrupted distribution operations
- Recovery of funds in case of smart contract issues

---

## 4. Royalty and Mover Advantage Mechanics

### 4.1 ERC-2981 Royalty Standard

Master IPO NFTs integrate with the ERC-2981 royalty standard, which:
- Encodes royalty percentages in the NFT metadata
- Enables royalty payments on secondary sales (where honored by marketplaces)
- Provides a technical mechanism for royalty distribution

**Note:** Royalty enforcement depends on marketplace support for ERC-2981. AudiFi cannot guarantee that all marketplaces will honor encoded royalties.

### 4.2 Mover Advantage Allocations (10/5/3/1)

The "Mover Advantage" system allocates secondary sale royalties based on acquisition timing:
- **10%** - Earliest participants (first tier)
- **5%** - Second tier participants
- **3%** - Third tier participants
- **1%** - Fourth tier participants

*[Note to Counsel: Specific mechanics and percentages to be confirmed based on final implementation.]*

The Mover Advantage system:
- Rewards early supporters of a Master IPO
- Is implemented through smart contract logic
- May be subject to platform fee allocations
- Is described as an incentive mechanism, not a guaranteed return

### 4.3 Artist Royalties

Artists receive ongoing royalties from:
- Primary sales of Master IPO NFTs
- Secondary sales (based on encoded percentages)
- Other revenue streams as defined in platform mechanics

Specific royalty percentages and allocations are displayed at the time of Master IPO creation.

## 5. Smart Contract and Technical Considerations

1. **Code Governs:** Smart contracts operate according to their coded instructions, which may differ from natural language descriptions

2. **Immutability:** Once deployed, smart contracts may be difficult or impossible to modify

3. **Bugs and Vulnerabilities:** Smart contracts may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or unintended behaviors

4. **Dependency Risks:** Smart contracts may depend on external systems, oracles, or other contracts that may fail

5. **Network Issues:** Blockchain networks may experience congestion, forks, or other issues affecting contract operation

### 5.2 Technical Failures

AudiFi is not liable for:
- Smart contract bugs or exploits
- Lost or misdirected funds or NFTs
- Blockchain network issues or failures
- Failed transactions or execution errors
- Gas fee volatility or failed transactions due to insufficient gas
