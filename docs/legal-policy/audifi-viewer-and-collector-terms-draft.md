2. **Traditional Securities:** The characterization of NFTs under securities laws is complex and subject to regulatory interpretation. Consult your own legal advisors.

3. **Guaranteed Returns:** NFTs are not guaranteed to appreciate in value, generate revenue, or maintain any value.

4. **Debt or Equity Instruments:** NFTs are not traditional debt obligations or equity interests in any entity.

### 3.3 Final Rights Description

The specific rights associated with any NFT are described in:
- Platform documentation at the time of purchase

The final characterization and legal nature of these rights is subject to detailed legal review and may vary by jurisdiction. You should consult qualified legal counsel regarding the rights you acquire.
