## 5. Steps Before Using AudiFi

### 5.1 Review Your Agreements

Before uploading content or initiating a Master IPO:

1. **Gather all relevant contracts** - Recording, publishing, management, distribution, collaboration agreements
2. **Read them carefully** - Look for exclusive rights, restrictions, and approval requirements
3. **Check key dates** - Note contract terms, reversion dates, and option periods
4. **Identify restrictions** - Note any provisions that might limit your use of AudiFi

### 5.2 Consult Legal Counsel

We strongly recommend:

1. **Hiring an entertainment attorney** who understands both traditional music contracts and digital/NFT matters
2. **Providing all relevant agreements** for review
3. **Asking specific questions** about your ability to use AudiFi for each piece of content
4. **Getting written advice** documenting your attorney's conclusions

### 5.3 Communicate with Your Team

If you have existing industry relationships:

1. **Discuss your plans** with your label, publisher, and/or manager
2. **Seek necessary permissions** if required by your agreements
3. **Document communications** and agreements in writing
4. **Clarify revenue treatment** for NFT income

### 5.4 Proceed with Caution

If there is any uncertainty:

1. **Do not upload content** until rights are clear
2. **Do not initiate Master IPOs** for disputed masters
3. **Seek explicit permission** rather than assuming rights
4. **Consider starting with unencumbered content** (self-produced, fully owned)
